# 🧠 Professor Evaluation

For a BCA 2nd year student:

This is GOOD beginner-level system scripting.

It shows:

- You understand loops
- You understand file system
- You can structure CLI logic
- You can combine functions + input handling

You’re moving from:

“Python learner”  
to  
“Python builder”

That’s a big shift.

# 🔥 Next Level Upgrade

If you want to make this impressive for internships:

Add:

- `try-except`
- Check if folder exists before creating
- Use `os.path.join()` instead of manual path building
- Add confirmation before delete
- Add argparse (professional CLI argument parsing)

---

Now one important question:

Do you want to stay in simple scripting  
or move toward backend developer level tools?

Because the next project I give you will decide that.
